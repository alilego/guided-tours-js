I've set up the basic project structure with:
    A modern, responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
    A navigation header with links to main sections
    A beautiful homepage with a hero section and featured tours
    Basic routing structure for tours, bookings, and authentication
    All necessary dependencies installed

The project is now ready for the next steps. Here's what we can do next:
    Set up the database with Prisma and Supabase
    Create the tours listing page
    Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
    Add the booking system
    Integrate Stripe for payments
    Would you like to proceed with any of these next steps?
